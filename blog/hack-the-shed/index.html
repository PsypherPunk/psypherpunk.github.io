Does anyone fancy trying one?‚Äù</em></blockquote><p>So, fairly innocuously, began what turned out to be a pretty interesting event.</p><span id=continue-reading></span><p>We recently ran a Capture the Flag (<abbr title="Capture the Flag">CTF</abbr>) event at my workplace. For anyone unfamiliar with the concept (which, in all fairness, was the position of many of the participants), there are a <a href=https://ctftime.org/ctf-wtf/>few variants</a> of CTF events but the essential premise is this: teams compete to find specific, intended vulnerabilities in a software application. Once found, the application presents the team with a code (the eponymous ‚Äúflag‚Äù) which gains the team points. At the end of the competition, the team with the most points wins. Simple, no?<p>The application in this instance was the <a href=https://www.owasp.org/index.php/OWASP_Juice_Shop_Project>OWASP Juice Shop</a>, a truly sublime piece of work, created by <a href=https://twitter.com/bkimminich>Bjoern Kimminich</a>. The site presents itself as a <em>‚Äúa small online shop which sells - surprise! - fruit & vegetable juice and associated products‚Äù</em>. In reality, it‚Äôs an immensely well-crafted presentation of potential (and all-too-real) security vulnerabilities.<p><img alt="OWASP Juice Shop" src=/img/juice-shop.png><h2 id=setup>Setup</h2><p>Getting an instance of the Juice Shop up and running is straightforward enough‚Äîit‚Äôs easily deployable as a <a href=https://elements.heroku.com/buttons/bkimminich/juice-shop>Heroku Element</a>, or you can get it running with Docker in a single command:<pre class=language-bash data-lang=bash style=color:#c0c5ce;background-color:#2b303b><code class=language-bash data-lang=bash><span style=color:#bf616a>docker</span><span> run</span><span style=color:#bf616a> --rm -p</span><span> 3000:3000 bkimminich/juice-shop
</span></code></pre><p>That‚Äôll give you a fully-functioning version of the Juice Shop at which you can hack away to your heart‚Äôs content. However, I wanted to keep the competition private and although Heroku does allow for restricting access, it comes at a cost. No, I was going to run this myself‚Ä¶<h3 id=deployment>Deployment</h3><p>Although the documentation is available for <a href=https://bkimminich.gitbooks.io/pwning-owasp-juice-shop/content/>free</a> on the web, it‚Äôs also available for purchase on <a href=https://leanpub.com/juice-shop>Leanpub</a>. In the hope that some of the money makes it back to the contributors, I‚Äôd highly recommend acquiring a copy.<p>By default, the application effectively runs in a ‚Äústandalone‚Äù mode, allowing users to find the various vulnerabilities but can also be run in CTF mode, presenting unique CTF flag codes upon discovery, again well <a href=https://bkimminich.gitbooks.io/pwning-owasp-juice-shop/content/part1/ctf.html>documented</a>.<p>For the purposes of the competition, there are two components: the Juice Shop itself (one per team) plus a scoreboard.<p>The scoreboard serves a multitude of purposes: handling registrations for each of the users (and their corresponding teams), offering a centralised point in which flags can be collated and tracked and, most importantly, presenting the scores for everyone to see.<p>There are two main scoreboards covered in the documentation: <a href=https://ctfd.io/about/>CTFd</a> and Facebook‚Äôs <a href=https://github.com/facebook/fbctf>fbctf</a>.<p>Spoilers: I opted for the former. The latter, although it has a nice aesthetic, presented far too many problems during setup while the former ‚Äújust worked‚Äù.<p>So my plan was this:<ul><li>I‚Äôd run a single virtual machine for the whole competition.<li>Each instance of the Juice Shop would have its own unique hostname.<li>The CTFd instance would run alongside them.</ul><p>Easy enough, right?<h3 id=the-virtual-machine>The Virtual Machine</h3><p>I opted for a Virtual Machine hosted by DigitalOcean (sorry, a <a href=https://www.digitalocean.com/products/droplets/><em>droplet</em></a>) running <a href=https://www.digitalocean.com/products/droplets/>Debian Stretch</a> (because <em>Debian</em>) and decided to run everything using Docker (because <em>DevOps</em>).<p>For the purposes of locking the machine down during setup, I used <a href=https://code.launchpad.net/ufw><em>Uncomplicated Firewall</em></a> to restrict access from anywhere except the office:<pre class=language-bash data-lang=bash style=color:#c0c5ce;background-color:#2b303b><code class=language-bash data-lang=bash><span style=color:#bf616a>sudo</span><span> ufw default deny incoming
</span><span style=color:#bf616a>sudo</span><span> ufw default allow outgoing
</span><span style=color:#bf616a>sudo</span><span> ufw allow from ${</span><span style=color:#bf616a>OFFICE_IP</span><span>} to ssh
</span></code></pre><h3 id=the-juice-shop-s>The Juice Shop(s)</h3><p>It‚Äôs worth noting that the Juice Shop does allow for <a href=https://bkimminich.gitbooks.io/pwning-owasp-juice-shop/content/part1/customization.html>customisation</a>‚Äîeverything from logos to shop items and such. However, frankly I didn‚Äôt want to detract from the beauty of the thing‚Äîit really is a marvel, the level of effort which has been applied to the project.<p>In order to generate unique keys for each of the flags (lest some enterprising participant use a code they happened upon elsewhere‚Ä¶) we first generated a random string:<pre class=language-bash data-lang=bash style=color:#c0c5ce;background-color:#2b303b><code class=language-bash data-lang=bash><span style=color:#bf616a>CTF_KEY</span><span>=$</span><span style=color:#a3be8c>(</span><span style=color:#bf616a>cat</span><span style=color:#a3be8c> /dev/urandom </span><span>| </span><span style=color:#bf616a>tr -dc </span><span>'</span><span style=color:#a3be8c>a-zA-Z0-9</span><span>' | </span><span style=color:#bf616a>fold -w</span><span style=color:#a3be8c> 32 </span><span>| </span><span style=color:#bf616a>head -n</span><span style=color:#a3be8c> 1)
</span></code></pre><p>Finally, for each instance of the Juice Shop that we needed (two, in our case), we launch a Docker container for each:<pre class=language-bash data-lang=bash style=color:#c0c5ce;background-color:#2b303b><code class=language-bash data-lang=bash><span style=color:#bf616a>docker</span><span> run</span><span style=color:#bf616a> -d </span><span>\
</span><span style=color:#bf616a>    --name</span><span> juice-shop-ctf \
</span><span style=color:#bf616a>    --env </span><span>"</span><span style=color:#a3be8c>CTF_KEY=</span><span>$</span><span style=color:#a3be8c>{</span><span style=color:#bf616a>CTF_KEY</span><span style=color:#a3be8c>}</span><span>" \
</span><span style=color:#bf616a>    --env </span><span>"</span><span style=color:#a3be8c>NODE_ENV=ctf</span><span>" \
</span><span style=color:#bf616a>    --publish </span><span>${</span><span style=color:#bf616a>JUICE_SHOP_PORT</span><span>}:3000 \
</span><span>    bkimminich/juice-shop
</span></code></pre><p>Note that each ran on a different port on the host (specified via <code>JUICE_SHOP_PORT</code> above) and we passed in the <code>CTF_KEY</code> value generated earlier.<h3 id=ctfd>CTFd</h3><p>Running an instance of the scoreboard was, thankfully, not much more difficult:<pre class=language-bash data-lang=bash style=color:#c0c5ce;background-color:#2b303b><code class=language-bash data-lang=bash><span style=color:#bf616a>git</span><span> clone https://github.com/CTFd/CTFd.git
</span><span style=color:#96b5b4>cd</span><span> CTFd/
</span></code></pre><p>Once we had a copy of the codebase there was only one further step before launching‚Äîincluding the random key we generated earlier. In the cloned folder, we need to edit the <code>docker-compose.yml</code> file to include a <code>SECRET_KEY</code> value:<pre class=language-bash data-lang=bash style=color:#c0c5ce;background-color:#2b303b><code class=language-bash data-lang=bash><span style=color:#bf616a>version: </span><span>'</span><span style=color:#a3be8c>2</span><span>'
</span><span>
</span><span style=color:#bf616a>services:
</span><span>  </span><span style=color:#bf616a>ctfd:
</span><span>    </span><span style=color:#bf616a>‚Ä¶
</span><span>    </span><span style=color:#bf616a>environment:
</span><span>      </span><span style=color:#bf616a>-</span><span> SECRET_KEY=${</span><span style=color:#bf616a>CTF_KEY</span><span>}
</span><span>      </span><span style=color:#bf616a>‚Ä¶
</span></code></pre><p>The <code>CTF_KEY</code> above was replaced with the <em>actual</em> generated value. Once that single line was added, the instance was ready to launch.<p>As hinted in the above step, CTFd uses <a href=https://docs.docker.com/compose/><code>docker-compose</code></a> to handle the various services which are needed, the installation instructions for which are nicely <a href=https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/>straightforward</a>. Once installed‚Ä¶<pre class=language-bash data-lang=bash style=color:#c0c5ce;background-color:#2b303b><code class=language-bash data-lang=bash><span style=color:#bf616a>docker-compose</span><span> up</span><span style=color:#bf616a> -d
</span></code></pre><h3 id=dns>DNS</h3><p>With two Juice Shop instances and a scoreboard running, it was time to make them accessible.<p>For reference, we had two teams: <em>Anomynoush</em> (an acknowledgement of the noted hacktivist collective and a visiting dignitary) and <em>H4ck t3h P14n3t!</em> (which, if you don‚Äôt get the reference: <em>shame on you!</em>). So we would need three subdomains:<ul><li><code>anomynoush.example.com</code><li><code>h4ckt3hp14n3t.example.com</code><li><code>ctfd.example.com</code></ul><p>Creating the various subdomains for each of the services was a matter of creating DNS <em>A records</em>‚Äîthe exact steps for this will vary depending on with whom your domain is registered. In this instance, the domain was registered with <a href=https://www.namecheap.com/>Namecheap</a> and their <a href=https://www.namecheap.com/support/knowledgebase/article.aspx/9776/2237/how-to-create-a-subdomain-for-my-domain>documentation</a> is decent enough, albeit specific to their interface.<h3 id=https>HTTPS</h3><p>Naturally we‚Äôre going to make everything accessible over HTTPS and that means <em>certificates</em>. And frankly, few services have done more for the proliferation of HTTPS than <a href=https://letsencrypt.org/><em>Let‚Äôs Encrypt</em></a>.<p>In this case, I used <a href=https://certbot.eff.org/><em>Certbot</em></a> to facilitate the creation of each certificate. There are a few different methods and various plugins but the steps that worked for me were:<pre class=language-bash data-lang=bash style=color:#c0c5ce;background-color:#2b303b><code class=language-bash data-lang=bash><span style=color:#bf616a>sudo</span><span> apt install certbot python-certbot-nginx
</span><span style=color:#bf616a>sudo</span><span> ufw allow 80
</span><span style=color:#bf616a>sudo</span><span> certbot</span><span style=color:#bf616a> --nginx -d </span><span>${</span><span style=color:#bf616a>CTF_HOST</span><span>}
</span><span style=color:#bf616a>sudo</span><span> ufw delete allow 80
</span></code></pre><p>Yes, it involved temporarily opening up port 80 in the firewall, but it <em>worked</em>. Once that was repeated for each of the hostnames (represented by <code>CTF_HOST</code> above), I just needed something to route traffic to the containers.<h3 id=nginx>NGINX</h3><p><a href=https://www.nginx.com/>NGINX</a> is <em>awesome</em>. In this case, it‚Äôs providing a reverse-proxy, handling routing of incoming requests to the corresponding containers.<p>Again, DigitalOcean have excellent <a href=https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-install-nginx-on-ubuntu-16-04>documentation</a> on the setup but here‚Äôs the setup for one of the Juice Shop instances:<pre class=language-nginx data-lang=nginx style=color:#c0c5ce;background-color:#2b303b><code class=language-nginx data-lang=nginx><span>server {

Thankfully, there‚Äôs a nice tool, <a href=https://www.npmjs.com/package/juice-shop-ctf-cli>juice-shop-ctf-cli</a> created for just this purpose. There‚Äôs some configuration but I created a <code>ctfd.yaml</code> file with the various options:<pre class=language-yaml data-lang=yaml style=color:#c0c5ce;background-color:#2b303b><code class=language-yaml data-lang=yaml><span style=color:#bf616a>ctfFramework</span><span>: </span><span style=color:#a3be8c>CTFd 2.x

</span></code></pre><p>This creates a ZIP file which can be uploaded to CTFd‚Äôs Admin. section.<h4 id=users-teams>Users & Teams</h4><p>CTFd allows for running competitions in either a user- or team-based mode. I wanted people to be grouped into teams with each person having their own login.<p>This is where I ran into issues.<p>The first step was to set up an <a href=https://myaccount.google.com/apppasswords>app. password</a> on my personal Gmail account. Once configured, I manually created accounts for each of the participants‚Äîand CTFd kindly forwarded the login details via email to each individual‚Äîand added the two teams.<p>At which point I couldn‚Äôt figure out for the life of me how to add users to those teams. Users can <em>create</em> teams and then pass the details to other users to join but no one could seemingly join the one‚Äôs I‚Äôd created.<p>After calmly reading the documentation and in no way panicking because it was lunch time and the competition was only a few hours away, I ended up nuking the CTFd instance.<p>And then it got <em>weird</em>‚Ä¶<p>After recreating the CTFd instance all my users were still there, as were the flags. But I‚Äôd removed the containers <em>entirely</em>‚Äîwhat was happening?! It turns out that CTFd keeps everything in local directory‚Äî<code>.data</code>‚Äîand that was persisting following the deletion.<p>So no, I wasn‚Äôt losing my mind; but I <em>was</em> running out of time‚Ä¶<p>By this point I‚Äôd pretty much given up. I‚Äôm sure the documentation covers it somewhere but I still couldn‚Äôt put my newly-created users in newly-created teams. So I cheated. Using some of the credentials I‚Äôd already minted for two of the users (one from each team), I created the team using that user. Then manually logged in as each user and joined the right team.<h2 id=running-the-event>Running the Event</h2><h3 id=beforehand>Beforehand</h3><p>On the day of the competition, I made a quick presentation earlier in the day, hoping to cover the running order and answer any queries (rather than doing everything 5 minutes before we started):<pre class=language-txt data-lang=txt style=color:#c0c5ce;background-color:#2b303b><code class=language-txt data-lang=txt><span>Start: 16:00
</span><span>gather teams,

</span><span>* don‚Äôt be a dick.
</span><span>* don‚Äôt break it.
</span><span>* have fun.
</span><span>* learn things.
</span></code></pre><h3 id=competition-time>Competition Time</h3><p>For the actual event, the two teams were set up in their own area. I‚Äôd asked that one person from each time stream to a nearby television; a separate TV was used to screen the scoreboard‚ÄîI‚Äôd hoped that we‚Äôd get a few spectators and this would keep things interesting. Turns out we did‚Äîa couple had even joined in and bagged a flag by the end of the competition.<p>At 16:00 the competitors grabbed beers, got their heads down and started. The competition‚Äôs duration was dictated by the official <a href="https://open.spotify.com/user/psypherpunk/playlist/1dZQGTDJMll0B5DBQN3bpp?si=u4GPy9_VRvOv7-OaKk83_A">soundtrack</a>, running for about 2 hours.<p>It was interesting to watch the various ways people worked through the hints. One team immediately created a Teams channel (our internal comms. tool of choice) to keep track of flags; some coordinated their team-mates, providing some excellent Google-fu to assist in tracking down some of the more obscure clues.<p>But, as the last bars of the soundtrack faded, there could be only one winning team‚Äî<em>Anomynoush</em>!‚Äîwho could claim the trophy: The Golden Hacker‚Ñ¢.<p><img alt="The Golden Hacker‚Ñ¢" src=/img/golden-hacker.jpg><h2 id=what-s-next>What‚Äôs next?</h2><p>The VM was budgeted for the month so the following day the Juice Shops were started back up to allow people to continue catching some of the more elusive flags.<p>One thing that had surprised me was the amount of progress made in that first hour. I‚Äôd intentionally kept the competition fairly short to avoid anyone feeling ‚Äústuck‚Äù; I should never have doubted them, should I? With that in mind, there‚Äôs now the intention to run some smaller, shorter sessions for anyone who couldn‚Äôt make it.<p>The CTF event was, I think, not only a great way to raise security awareness within teams but it was <em>fun</em>.
